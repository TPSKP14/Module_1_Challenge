# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of the excel kickstarter analysis was to determine the success rate of kickstarter campaigns, with varying conditions.  More specifically, it examined the ideal monetary goal to set for a kickstarter that intended to fund a play and ideal timing for launching a kickstarter campaign.  The project looked at a variety of kickstarter campaigns to exam different rates of success, worldwide, for kickstarter campaigns
## Analysis and Challenges
Through the course of the challenge, I used pivot tables, charts, graphs and a variety of functions including Countifs, sum, and years to name a few. 
One challenge I had in particular is delineating between the Countif and Countifs function.  Originally, I was stuck because I used Countif instead of Countifs and was unable to enter multilple critera and arguments into my function to perform the analysis.  Additionally, filtering and pivot table organization took some time to get used to - though now I feel I am very much familiar with both

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Based on the launch date of a kickstarter campaign, it appears they are most successful in the spring.  Additionally, failure rates did not change significantly based on the timing.  Furthermore, as time went on and Kickstarter became more popluar, results became more varied.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on goals set for a kickstarter campaign, it is apparent that campaigns with more modest or lower goals were more successful and generally speaking campaigns with the highest and loftiest goals were least successful.  Any goals that were in between seem to be quite varied.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The countifs vs countif function.  Fortunately, gained a much better understanding of excel functions and pivtot tables

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Kickstarters are most successful in the spring, failure rates did not change significantly based on timing
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
campaigns which set more modest and achievable goals were typically more successful.  
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The limitations of the data set are that the sample size per year, especially early on, is very limited.  Additionally, there much more information for the USA, but other countries kickstarter experience is much lower
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could create a graph that related the number of backers to the success rate.  We could also create a chart to show success rates of staff picks vs non staff picks
